**Real-time Ride-Share Tracking\***

**Overview**

This project aims to provide a real-time ride-sharing tracking solution for transportation agencies operating in Kigali. The web application utilizes the Google Maps API to navigate a predefined route from Nyabugogo to Kimironko, with stops at five intermediate locations. The application dynamically displays the estimated time to reach each upcoming stop along the route. Users can track the movement of the bus, represented by a marker at the origin, as it progresses along the route. By observing the marker's movement and location updates, users can gauge the real-time progress of their journey and anticipate arrival times at each stop. you can access the deployed version of this project https://real-time-ride-sharing.vercel.app/.
